#### About Me

- 👋 I'm Joe (he/him). 
- 🔭 I’ve been exploring tech since I was a kid.
- 📝 I work as a technical and UX writer. 
- 💻 I enjoy programming and I build things for the web in my free time.
- 🦀 I’m currently learning [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
- 📖 I'm usually reading a lot of different books all at once. You can see what I'm reading on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/joeisreading). 
- 🤔 I’m always looking for opportunities to learn from more experienced developers and writers.
- 💬 I love talking about specialty coffee, history, good books, software documentation, cycling, aquariums, and Arsenal FC.
- 🎮 I've been fascinated by manuals and guides since I began playing [Ninja Turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(NES_video_game)) for NES with my dad in the early 90s.
